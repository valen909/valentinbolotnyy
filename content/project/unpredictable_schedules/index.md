title: How Unpredictable Schedules Widen the Gender Pay Gap
summary: "With [Natalia Emanuel](https://www.nataliaemanuel.com/). July 1st, 2022. *The authors analyzed seven years of pay data for bus and train operators employed by the MBTA at union-negotiated rates and found that even among people in exactly the same role at the same seniority level, women still took home 11% less than men. They identified three factors driving this persistent earnings gap: unpredictable, unconventional, and uncontrollable schedules.*"
