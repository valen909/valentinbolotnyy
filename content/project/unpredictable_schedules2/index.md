title: How Unpredictable Schedules Widen the Gender Pay Gap
summary: "Policy Story for PolicyEd with [Natalia Emanuel](https://www.nataliaemanuel.com/). January 4th, 2023. *The gender pay gap can remain even among workers with the same role, seniority, and pay structure. One reason is due to unpredictable scheduling. When schedules are unpredictable, women are less likely than men to be able to accept last-minute overtime opportunities and to work odd hours. Making schedules more predictable can help reduce the gap.*"
