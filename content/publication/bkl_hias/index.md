abstract: "State repression durably impacts political behaviors in repressed populations, yet research has largely focused on individuals remaining in affected places. Seldom considered are behaviors of individuals who flee to other countries. We examine one such population, Jews exiting the Soviet Bloc, using a unique administrative dataset rarely available in the immigration context. Applying a within-family research design, we examine the impact of having lived longer in the Soviet Bloc on political behavior. In contrast with typical findings of state repression's demobilizing effects, we find that siblings who lived longer in the Soviet Union are significantly more likely to vote in elections. We also find a differentially greater tendency to affiliate with conservative political parties, which we attribute to backlash against communism. We consider alternative mechanisms including family dynamics and economics, and find supportive evidence for similar effects in Israel, one of the other major recipients of this refugee population."

# "Using administrative data on Jewish refugees fleeing the Former Soviet Bloc for the United States between 1955 and 2000, along with survey data on Israeli citizens born in the Former Soviet Bloc, we demonstrate persistent downstream political consequences of living as a targeted minority under a repressive, communist regime. Using a within-family research design, we show that individuals who spent longer periods living under a Soviet Bloc government are more likely to engage in backlash against the regime that oppressed them by (1) being more likely to vote in their new democratic countries and (2) affiliating with right-wing political parties most unlike ruling regimes in their origin countries."
