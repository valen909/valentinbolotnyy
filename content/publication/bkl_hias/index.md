abstract: "Where do the political behaviors and preferences of refugees come from? We compile a novel database of over 600,000 immigration records from a large U.S. resettlement agency and link these to national voter files. We show that an immigrant’s origin country influences voting behavior and partisan preferences. Using a between-siblings design, we find each additional year of time spent in an immigrant’s birth country is associated with an increased chance of voting in midterm (2.3%) and presidential elections (0.8%), as well as her probability of registering as a Republican in adulthood by 2.2%. A Facebook survey of the resettled population highlights how birth country influences political beliefs: immigrants who arrive in the U.S. at older ages look less like ideological partisans than people who arrive at younger ages. We propose four hypotheses for why more time in the origin country manifests as increased civic engagement and increased conservatism in this refugee population."
