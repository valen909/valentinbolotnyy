I am an economist on a [5-year research fellowship](https://www.hoover.org/hoover-fellows-program) at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. I work on topics across public and labor economics, often partnering with agencies at all levels of government to improve public services and gain insight into social behavior. 

I received a PhD in Economics from Harvard University and a BA in Economics and International Relations from Stanford University.
